INTRODUCTION:

Due to the high competition in the telecommunications industry, maintaining customer loyalty is of utmost importance. Telecom companies encounter substantial hurdles in preserving their customer base due to the increase in the number of service providers and the simplicity of switching between them. A vital indicator for assessing customer loyalty is the churn rate, representing the proportion of subscribers who terminate their service within a specified timeframe.

Understanding the factors influencing customer churn is crucial for telecom providers in order to formulate successful retention tactics. Fortunately, telecom companies gather extensive data on customer behavior, demographics, and other aspects.

Through the application of sophisticated data analysis methods, valuable insights can be revealed to forecast potential churn among customers, facilitating proactive measures to enhance retention rates.

The project focuses on analyzing a dataset from kaggle, consisting of customer information from Telecom, in order to forecast customer churn. The dataset encompasses diverse attributes including customer demographics, usage behaviors, and other pertinent details. The objective is to investigate these attributes to detect trends and relationships that could suggest the probability of a customer churning.
